## Description
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
This analysis explores crime data in Australia, focusing on trends, patterns, and correlations across different crime types and locations. The goal is to uncover insights into crime rates, demographic influences, and potential predictive factors using statistical and machine learning techniques. By leveraging data visualization and quantitative analysis, this project aims to provide a clearer understanding of crime dynamics and assist policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and researchers in making informed decisions.
